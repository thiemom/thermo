# Thermo

A C++ library for thermodynamic calculations with a focus on humid air properties.

## Overview

This library provides tools for calculating thermodynamic properties of gases, with a particular focus on humid air calculations using the Hyland-Wexler equations. It includes functionality for:

- Thermodynamic property calculations
- Saturation vapor pressure calculations for water and ice
- Humid air composition and property calculations
- Mole fraction utilities

## Features

- Accurate saturation vapor pressure calculations using Hyland-Wexler equations
  - For ice (-80°C to 0°C): Maximum relative error ≤ 0.023%
  - For water vapor (0°C to 80°C): Maximum relative error ≤ 0.0057%
- Dry air composition handling (N₂, O₂, Ar, CO₂)
- Humidity ratio calculations
- Mole fraction normalization and conversion utilities
 - Ideal-gas thermodynamic helpers, including Cp, H, S and Gibbs free energy
   via `g_over_RT` and its temperature derivative `dg_over_RT_dT`

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites
